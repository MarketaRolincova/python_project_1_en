# Text analyzer

# Project entry

In this project, my goal is to create a text analyzer - a program that will be able to sift through an arbitrarily long text and find out various information about it:

1. It asks the user for a login name and password,
2. finds out if the entered data corresponds to any of the registered users,
3. if he is registered, greet him and allow him to analyze the texts,
4. if it is not registered, it warns him and terminates the program.
5. The program lets the user choose between three texts stored in the TEXTS variable:
- If the user selects a text number that is not in the entry, the program warns him and ends,
- if the user enters an input other than a number, the program also warns him and exits.
6. Calculates the following statistics for the selected text:
- word count,
- the number of words starting with a capital letter,
- the number of words written in capital letters,
- the number of words written in lowercase letters,
- number of numbers (not digits),
- the sum of all numbers (not digits) in the text.
7. The program will display a simple bar graph that will represent the frequency of different word lengths in the text.
